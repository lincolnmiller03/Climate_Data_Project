As the effect of climate change gradually manifest around us, it can be hard to discern the gradual changes in the weather around us fitting into a large-scale shift. The American midwest has been labelled a 'climate haven' by some, a region where the effects of climate change will not be as disruptive as, say, on the eastern seaborad. My research question explores the short-term shift in precipitation in four Midwestern cities (Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, and St. Louis) over the past decade: Are any of these cities experiencing less precipitation than they were 10 years? Is the difference significant?

The figure 'Monthly Precipitation Trends (2013-2023) shows the monthly average precipitation across the period of evaluation for each city. This visual serves as a primer to our research question, helping to establish the yearly cycle that these cities have in their precipitation. For all cities, precipitation appears to peak in late spring or early summer. Minneapolis appears to be the driest city on average, while Chicago, Madison, or St. Louis may be the wettest depending on the time of year or that individual year's weather pattern.

Our next figure, 'Monthly Precipitation Comparsion: 2013 vs. 2023', provides a direct comparison of annual precipitation in the years at the start and end of our period of evaluation. In addition, horizontal lines are added to show the average precipitation for that respective year. In all of the cities, a decrease in precipitation is observed when comparing 2023 to 2013. So, it is clear that in comparison to a decade ago, our cities of interest experienced a decrease in precipitiation.

In our final figure, '2013 vs. 2023 Precipitation Differences', the differences in average precipitation are tested at the 10% significance level. Our null hypothesis is that precipitation levels are not different from 2013 to 2023, and the alternative hypothesis is that the levels of precipitation are different. In our results, we find the only city we are able to reject the null hypothesis for is Madison. The other cities-Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis-did not have a statistically significant decrease in their precipitation levels in the compared years. This suggests that while short-term dyring trends may be emerging some areas of the Midwest, they are not widespread or robust enough to conclusively indicate a regional shift.

These findings prompt further questions: Is Madison's significant decrease an outlier, or does it signal an early indicator of broader changes-a canary in the coal mine? Additionally, while the Midwest has been considered a potential 'climate haven,' localized reductions in precipitation could still impact agriculture, water resources, and urban planning. Future reearch should expand the analysis to include longer time frames, mor ecities, and additional climate variables to better assess whether these trends persist or intensify. 

Ultimately, while the Midwest may fare better than coastal regions facing rising sea levels and extreme storms, these preliminary results suggest that even so-called climate havens are not entirely immune to changing weather patterns. Monitoring these shifts will be crucial for policymakers and residents as they prepare for an uncertain future.
